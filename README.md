Forecasting COVID-19 cases in Realtime for different countries.

How to forecast the rise/decline or COVID-19 cases for a country or region?

On 11 February 2020, WHO announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19.
This virus has taken the world by storm. After first detected in China, now coronavirus has spread in about 212 countries. There has been an exponential growth in the total number of cases for each country around the globe. As of 5th June 2020, the total reported cases reached 12965302 out of which 755517 have died.
In the current pandemic Scenario of COVID-19, The number of infected patients and death toll are on the rise. Given the current rate of growth, where can the cases expect to reach in the next 10 days, if no specific precaution is taken? 

In this tutorial, I have explained the time series forecasting of COVID-19 cases for different countries in the python programming language.  I have tried to explain it with the codes. 

Below are the Features of Implemented Model
1.	Data is real-time taken directly from the website (updated daily)
2.	 Country-wise analysis
3.	 Gives prediction for the upcoming number of days starting from today
4.	 Any change in the trend of the data is captured during training on real-time data
